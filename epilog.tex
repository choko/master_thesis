\section*{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Since manual transcription of recordings is expensive
      it would be good to make users transcribe only parts of the recordings
      in which ASR system wasn't confident enough \todo{cite (http://www.phontron.com/paper/sperber14slt.pdf)}.
    This idea could be used for both user transcription and CrowdFlower transcription.

  \item
    With manually transcribed recordings from CloudASR platform
      it is possible to continuously improve accuracy of the underlying ASR system
      by adapting the language model to the type of language that the users of the CloudASR really use.
    Thus CloudASR could provide an option to automatically update language model
      when a certain amount of new transcribed recordings was collected.

  \item
    Because running CloudASR platform is expensive in terms of costs for a server hosting,
      it would be good to optimize usage of individual workers
      so that spare workers are shut down when there is no need for them
      and new workers are started when the traffic arise.
    This can be achieved either by providing feedback control based systems \todo{cite (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028970.do)}
      or by using machine learning techniques. \todo{cite}

  \item
    As CloudASR platform provides API for speech recognition,
      it could also be used for another speech related tasks like Language Identification, Speaker Identification, Voice Activity Detection, etc.

\end{itemize}
